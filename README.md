# Game Database Project

**Project Description**
The world of video games is a vast and ever-expanding realm that encompasses a diverse range of genres, platforms, and experiences. While major video game releases often receive extensive coverage and reviews in the media, there exists a substantial number of games that remain relatively untouched by mainstream attention. These lesser-known games may offer unique and engaging experiences that go unnoticed by potential players. This problem domain seeks to address the need for a comprehensive database and tool that can provide valuable information about these underrepresented video games, allowing consumers to make informed decisions when choosing which games to play.
